I currently live in Cambridge, MA. I majored in Computer Science and minored in
Classics at Pomona College.

## Projects and Contributions

- [vim-markdown-composer](https://github.com/euclio/vim-markdown-composer).
  A [neovim](neovim.io) plugin that adds asynchronous markdown preview
  functionality. Upon opening a markdown file, the plugin opens a browser window
  that renders the markdown in real-time using websockets. The markdown preview
  server, [aurelius](https://github.com/euclio/aurelius), is editor-agnostic.
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). I have contributed significantly to the Rust
  compiler's rich diagnostics. I have also worked on
  [`rustdoc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html), Rust's
  built-in documentation tool, where I overhauled the documentation test syntax
  checking passes.
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo). Rust's package manager. I
  implemented the widely used `cargo test --all` feature and `cargo help` for
  third-party subcommands.
- [FeO Boy](https://github.com/fishberg/feo-boy). A cycle-accurate emulator
  for the Nintendo Game Boy written in Rust.
- [Room Full of Cats](https://github.com/gamefolk/room-full-of-cats). A
  puzzle-action game for the Nintendo Game Boy, written in C. The game is
  playable on actual hardware.
- [ChipLang](https://github.com/euclio/chip-lang). A domain-specific
  programming language for composing chiptune. Implemented in Scala. The
  repository contains examples of songs implemented in ChipLang, including the
  Super Mario Bros. theme song and the prelude from Final Fantasy.
- [FBFS](https://github.com/euclio/fbfs). The Facebook Filesystem. FBFS is
  an alternative interface for Facebook where friends, statuses, photos, etc.
  are represented as files on a local filesystem. The repository contains a
  [research
  paper](https://github.com/euclio/fbfs/blob/master/paper/final_paper.pdf)
  describing the C++ implementation.
- [_Rust vs. D: Exploring Possible Successors of
  C++_](https://github.com/euclio/senior-project). My work for the Pomona
  College Senior Exercise as part of my degree. I held a study where computer
  science students attempted to implement a series of example programs in C++,
  D, and Rust. I studied the number and types of bugs that arose, and discussed
  how various language features assisted in preventing such bugs in a paper.

## Other Interests

I enjoy traveling throughout the Northeast, the outdoors, playing video games,
and listening to music. My favorite games include *Wario Land III*, *Super Mario
World*, and *Earthbound*. I keep an up-to-date
[backlog](https://backloggery.com/euclio) of the games I've played. My favorite
band is [Freezepop](http://freezepop.net). I am a fan of chip music of all
kinds, particularly from retro games and the demoscene.
